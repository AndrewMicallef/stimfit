version 0.8.5, 04/22/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
Still a 0.9 development version.
1. Updated documentation.

version 0.8.4, 04/15/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yet another development version for 0.9.
1. NSIS-based installer for Windows.
2. Some more functions accessible from Python. Corrected a few bugs in existing functions.
	
version 0.8.3, 04/13/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
Development version for 0.9.
1. Integration of a python shell, allowing low-level access to data as NumPy arrays.
   Started with a couple of basic functions. Type "stf." at the shell prompt to see
   a list. Opening a bracket (as in "get_trace( ") will pop up a documentation window.
2. Changes to the GUI: Single row for tool bars, channel selection possible at any
   time, no channel selection at startup
3. New window from selected traces of the current file (as opposed to all files).
4. Maximal slope of rise in inactive channel can be restricted to the peak window.
5. Non-linear regression:
   - Don't use Jacobian if a function is not continuously differentiable.
   - Multi-pass fit: Best-fit parameters from the previous pass are re-used with a smaller
     initial step size until no further decrease in the error can be achieved.
   - Decreased initial step size. Seems to be more robust most of the time, especially
     when used with the multi-pass algorithm.
   - Draw smooth fit curves between sampling points.
   
version 0.8.2, 02/13/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Fit start cursor can follow the peak automatically (Edit->Cursor settings...->Decay). 
2. Installer for Windows.
3. Fixed some printing issues in Windows. Print preview still produces bogus
   (Linux & Windows), was therefore temporarily removed.
4. Smarter initialisation for multi-exponential functions. Better warning messages for
   non-linear regression.
5. Updated enhanced metafile to be compatible with wxWidgets 2.9.
	
version 0.8.1, 01/19/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Corrected a severe bug in the non-linear regression dialog. 
2. Updated levmar to 2.2. 

version 0.8.0, 01/16/08, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Link everything statically (as far as possible) so that a single, monolithic executable
   is produced. This will avoid several severe bugs that were due to multiple shared library 
   versions on the same machine. The Windows executable can now be used from a USB stick.
   This is not possible with the Linux version because several libraries are still shared.
2. New event editing mode: Once some events have been detected, false positives can be 
   unselected (using checkboxes) and false negatives can be corrected using a right click.
   After editing, events can be extracted into a new window.
3. Removed a bug when the number of points for mean peak calculation were read from the 
   cursors settings dialog.
4. Unselect some traces at regular intervals.
5. Added Doxygen-documentation to the code.
6. Re-organised the code for monolithic compilation (see 1.). 
7. Integrated the levmar source.

   as well now
3. Corrected a bug when copying & pasting tables: an empty column and row were added
4. Copying from tables with Ctrl + 'c'  
5. Pad sections in ATF files with zeros when exporting files with variable section sizes

version 0.7.08, 05/31/07, CSH----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Save multiple channels to binary file

4. Corrected a bug in the Linux version of template matching

version 0.7.02, 04/15/07, CSH----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ported to Unix/Linux. Modified cfs/abf libraries so that they can be called from Unix. 
   Known restrictions: Some problems with std::valarray (because it's not automatically
   resized during copy operations in the gcc implementation); no atf support; menu is too
   large and covers parts of the toolbars.

version 0.6.21, 02/02/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cursor settings are now in a single, tabbed dialog (Settings->Cursor). You can choose
   between units (pts or ms). The dialog applies to the currently active file 
   (==View/Document). When switching between child windows, the settings will be updated.
   
version 0.6.20, 01/30/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduced a measurement cursor that will show the value of data at a specific time. It
   is selected by pressing 'm'. The cursor will be shown as a crosshair. Results are shown
   as the first entry in the results dialog bar.
2. In coordinate-mode, time=0 can be set to beginning of trace (View->synchronize x scale).

version 0.6.19, 01/24/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. No of points for peak calculation written to registry not only upon closing a file, but
   whenever it is changed in the dialog.

version 0.6.18, 01/24/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. No of points for peak calculation are read/written from/to registry upon opening/closing
   a file
   
version 0.6.17, 01/21/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Added support for user-defined routines, similar to the function library (see 0.6.13).
   Users can add routines to a dll (extend.dll).
   
version 0.6.16, 01/08/07, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Changed application and source code file names to "Stimfit" instead of "SFWinMDI"
2. Corrected a bug in linear interpolation - still unstable at times, will need further
   debugging.
   
version 0.6.15, 12/22/06, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Bessel filter function adjusted so that cutoff frequency is at -3 dB
2. Added Gaussian filter, calculated in frequency domain (according to Colquhoun & Sigworth,
   ch. 19 of Single Channel Recording).

version 0.6.14, 12/19/06, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Corrected a bug: Y-Scale bar label of second channel was wrong.
2. Corrected a bug: Align-mode while averaging two channels didn't work properly.
3. Sections are now given descriptions when a new window is created via New from...
   The sections' descriptions are written into Yt-files.
4. Fits are stored with the trace so that the fit can be seen if the
   trace is activated again.
5. Adaptive ASCII import, as suggested by Bill Anderson. Known restriction: x-units
   setting has no effect.
   
version 0.6.13, 12/07/06, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Function library for non-linear regression can now be extended (more easily) by the user:
   Functions are now in a dll (funclib.dll) that can be compiled with a free compiler
   (Visual C++ Express) since there is no MFC stuff in it. I haven't tested other compilers
   (such as gcc or Borland) yet, however, I suppose they won't work because the format 
   of exported C++ functions in shared libraries is different between compilers.
2. Very basic reading of WinLTP *.P0 files
3. Speed of trace drawing increased for large traces (>50000 sampling points): first, only
   the part that can actually be seen in the window is drawn; second, traces can optionally
   be downsampled by unchecking View->Full resolution.
4. Results of last fit can now be recovered (View->Results->Last fit)
5. All traces from all open windows can now be collected in a new window. The sequence of
   traces depends on the sequence of file opening.
6. Revised large parts of the code; this version is therefore "experimental", because nobody
   has thoroughly tested it yet.
    
version 0.6.12, 11/26/06, CSH---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Minor changes to the code

1. Only double precision versions of fftw are used now, making the installer package con-
   siderably smaller.
2. levmar code compiled directly into the executable instead of linking against levmar.lib;
   the executable is now only 380 KB in size.
   
version 0.6.6, 11/03/06, CSH----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Coordinates can be chosen instead of scale bars
2. Scale bar labels aligned to bars

3. Same known bugs as in 0.52 

version 0.53, 02/13/06, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Switched to Lourakis' implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, first, because
   it's open source (in contrast to the NR code), second, because it's more robust than the 
   NR version.
2. Switched to fftw instead of the NR implementation of the ft. Same reasons apply.
3. Down-sampling option when printing
4. The first window's settings (zoom, calculation limits) can be applied to all other open 
   windows
5. Same known bugs as in 0.52

version 0.52, 01/18/06, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------

   will be aligned to the steepest rise of the inactive channel
2. Fixed a bug when calculating the average in single-channel mode
3. Increased speed of average calculation (SD not determined by default any more, switched 
   from 8-byte to 4-byte array)
4. Dialog bars updated when switching between child windows
5. Known bug: The radio button selection for mouse actions (peak/base/...) will disappear
   when selecting one of the zoom modes (C1/C2/C1+2). Haven't found a workaround yet.
6. Known bug: program will run slower when files are opened by double-clicking them

version 0.51, 01/10/06, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Basic 2-channel support, at least for viewing. No change to the SDI-version's 2-channel-
   support.
2. Increased character array size for CFS file variables from 200 to 1024. Should be enough
   for Igor Scripts.

version 0.50, 12/14/05, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. MDI
   I've finally implemented a multiple document interface (MDI). Whenever
   the data is manipulated (e.g. filtered or averaged), a new child window 
   will pop up showing the result. The new data can then be saved into a 
   file.
2. Dialog bars
   I've eliminated the infamous Trace Navigator. Its contents have been
   moved to two dialog bars. The results are now shown in a dialog bar as
   well. In addition, you can choose which results to show from the menu
   (View->Results). Your settings will be written to the registry so that
   they will be recovered next time you start the program.
3. Advanced averaging
   Every n-th trace can now be averaged; thereby, n averages will be created
   (and shown in a new child window, as mentioned earlier)
4. Code
   I've revised large parts of the code. The most significant change is
   the introduction of the "Recording" template class where all the data is
   stored and managed.

version 0.34, 09/23/04, CSH-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. First decay cursor can automatically be set to peak
