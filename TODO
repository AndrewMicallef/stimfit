* Enable writing of Latency cursors in Stimfit profile (check wxGetProfileInt and wxWriteProfileInt in wxStfApp). Additionaly, consider to write zero-based index too the configuration. (done)

* Channel selection: when uncheking show, the scale bar/units are still on. Check in graph.cpp how to solve it.

* Averages: There is some discrepancies in the average when using more than
2 channels
