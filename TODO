Bugs reported by Stephanie
* in stf.show_table_dictlist() the ordering of the dictionary list in the grid is random; the elements of the dictionary will not appear in the grid as they are written in the dictionary, nor appear alphabetically as in stf.shot_table. Besides that,
the key of the dictionary doest not show in the column (it says A, B and so on).
