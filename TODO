* Remove red scalebar if channel is not selected: when uncheking show inactive channel , the red scale bar/units are still on. Check in graph.cpp how to solve it. wxStfGraph::CreateScale(&DC) is used to  create scale bars and labelings. If we use wxStfChildframe->ShowSecond() we can see the status of Show in Channel.

* Averages: There is some discrepancies in the average when using more than 2 channels

* Reorganize Channel selection childframe 
* Add Analysis toolbar to the Extensions menu
* There is a problem with the zero-based index
* When pressing L, change latency measurements to manual

* in stf.show_table_dictlist() the ordering of the dictionary list in the grid is random; the elements of the dictionary will not appear in the grid as they are written in the dictionary, nor appear alphabetically as in stf.shot_table. Besides that,
the key of the dictionary doest not show in the column (it says A, B and so on).
