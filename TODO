* Enable change threshold slope in Slope page of Cursor settings menu

* Add python commands for the Slope calculation (setting cursors, getting slope, setting Delta T mode, etc..)

* Add a column with the Slope results in the Batch analysis

* DONE (Jan 23 22:12:33 CET 2011) : Enable writing of Latency cursors in Stimfit profile (check wxGetProfileInt and wxWriteProfileInt in wxStfApp). Additionaly, consider to write zero-based index too the configuration. (done)

* Remove red scalebar if channel is not selected: when uncheking show inactive channel , the red scale bar/units are still on. Check in graph.cpp how to solve it. wxStfGraph::CreateScale(&DC) is used to  create scale bars and labelings. If we use wxStfChildframe->ShowSecond() we can see the status of Show in Channel.

* Averages: There is some discrepancies in the average when using more than 2 channels

Wed May 11 09:23:14 CEST 2011
* Reorganize Channel selection childframe 
* Add Analysis toolbar to the Extensions menu
* There is a problem with the zero-based index
* When pressing L, change latency measurements to manual
