Source code structure
=====================

./src/libstfio    -- File i/o library for common electrophysiology formats
./src/pystfio     -- Python wrapper around libstfio
./src/stimfit     -- Stimfit program
./src/stimfit/py  -- stf module that gets imported into the embedded Python
                     shell

As of yet, libstfio is a private library that won't be installed system-wide.
You may therefore end up with two copies of libstfio.so: One in the private
stimfit library directory (/usr/lib/stimfit/ or similar), the other one in
the Python site packages path for pystfio.
libstfio may turn into a system-wide library in the future.
